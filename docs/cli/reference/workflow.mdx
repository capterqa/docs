## Overview

The Capter workflows are written in YAML. If you don't know YAML, check out [Learn YAML in five minutes](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1214409/Learn-YAML-in-five-minutes).

The workflow files should be located under `.capter/` in your projects root folder.

## Example workflow

```yml
# ./capter/product-crud.yml

name: product crud
env:
  product_name: M1 MacBook Air
headers:
  Authorization: bearer ${{ mask env.JWT }}
steps:
  - name: create product
    id: create
    url: ${{ env.URL }}/products
    method: POST
    body:
      name: ${{ env.product_name }}
    assertions:
      - !expect status to_equal 201
      - !expect body.name to_equal ${{ env.product_name }}

  - name: fetch product
    url: ${{ env.URL }}/products/${{ create.response.body.id }}
    assertions:
      - !expect status to_equal 200
      - !expect body.name to_equal ${{ env.product_name }}
```

## Root

### `name`

This is the name of the workflow and will be displayed in the CLI output.

### `url`

You can set the URL at the root level or per step. The root level URL will be used as the default, but the step one takes precedence.

### `method`

You can set the method at the root level or per step. The root level method will be used as the default, but the step one takes precedence.

### `headers`

Add headers to _every request_. These will merge with any headers defined in the step. This is a good place to put something like content type or authorization.

```yml
headers:
  Content-type: application/json
  Authorization: bearer ${{ env.JWT }}
```

### `skip`

Skips the workflow and all its steps.

### `env`

Passing an object here will make it available together with the rest of the environment variables using a template tag:

```yml
env:
  foo: bar
steps:
  query:
    foo: ${{ env.foo }} # -> bar
```

### `steps`

A step is basically a configuration for an HTTP request that the CLI will make when you run it. Each workflow needs to include one or more steps for it do actually do anything. See the [step reference](#step) below. You pass the steps as a YAML array:

```yml
steps:
  - name: step 1
    url: ${{ env.URL }}/products

  - name: step 2
    url: ${{ env.URL }}/product/1
```

## Step

### `name`

This is the name of the step and will be displayed in the CLI output.

### `url`

Where to make the request.

### `method`

The method used when making the request.

Defaults to `GET`.

### `query`

Adds a query to the url:

```yml
url: https://fake-api.capter.io/products
query:
  id: 1
```

The above will generate `https://fake-api.capter.io/products?id=1`.

### `headers`

Add headers to the request:

```yml
headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
```

If you send tokens for authorization for all steps in a workflow, it might make sense to put it at the [root level](#headers) instead.

#### Example JWT login flow

```yml
# ./capter/login.yml

name: login
steps:
  - name: login
    id: login
    url: ${{ env.url }}/login
    method: POST
    body:
      email: ${{ env.email }}
      password: ${{ env.password }}

  - name: fetch logged in user
    url: ${{ env.url }}/me
    headers:
      # use token from login response
      Authorization: bearer ${{ login.response.token }}
    assertions:
      - !expect body.email to_equal ${{ env.email }}
```

### `body`

Add a body to the request:

```yml
- name: create product
  body:
    product_name: M1 MacBook Air
    price: 999
```

### `skip`

Skips the step.

### `assertions`

A list of assertions that will run after the request gets a response:

```yml
assertions:
  - !expect status to_equal 200
  - !expect duration to_be_below 4000
  - !expect body.email to_equal filip@capter.io
```

See the [Aassertion reference page](/cli/reference/assertions).
