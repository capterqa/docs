To make sure that you API is working correctly, you probably want to add some assertions to your workflows â€“ and Capter makes that super easy!

You write the assertions in _plain English_, and Capter parses them in to actual assertions.

## Asserting on a response

You add assertion at the end of each _step_:

```yml {5-7}
# .capter/products.yml

name: products
steps:
  - name: fetch all products
    url: https://fake-api.capter.io/api/products
    assertions:
      - !assert status equal 200
      - !assert body isArray
```

In the above example we assert that the status equals 200 and that the body we get back is an array.

### What you can assert on

There are four things you can assert on:

- `status` - the HTTP status you get back
- `body` - the response body
- `headers` - the response headers
- `duration` - how long it took to get a response back

### Testing the opposite using the `!!` operator

You can invert a test by adding an extra `!` at the start of the assertion string:

```yml
- !!assert status equal 500
```

The above test **will fail** if the status equals 500. This is equal to the `.not` extension you see in many other test frameworks.

## Composing an assertion

Sometimes you want to assert that a response matches something in a previous response, for example:

- Create a product
  - Assert that we get a product with an `id` back
- Use the `id` from the create response to fetch the product
  - Assert that the `id` of that user matches the `id` in the create step

In a Capter workflow, that would look something like this:

```yml {13}
# ./capter/product-crud.yml

name: product crud
steps:
  - name: create product
    id: create
    url: https://fake-api.capter.io/products
    method: POST
    assertions:
      - !assert body.id exists

  - name: fetch product
    url: https://product-api.com/products/${{ create.response.body.id }}
    assertions:
      - !assert body.id equal ${{ create.response.body.id }}
```

As you can see on the highlighted line above, we can use values from the previous step in our assertions!
