Using environment variables is a powerful way of running the same tests in different environments.

## `.env` file

You can add environment variables in your `.env` file, and Capter will automatically read it.

```makefile
# testing locally
URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

```makefile
# testing prod
URL="https://my-prod-api.com"
```

## Inline

You can also run the CLI with the environment variables inline in the command:

```console
URL=http://localhost:3000 capter test
```

## Using the variables

To use the environment variable, you can use the template tag syntax and the `env` context:

```yaml {7}
# .capter/products.yml

name: products
steps:
  - name: fetch all products
    # grab the base URL from an environment variable
    url: ${{ env.URL }}/api/products
    assertions:
      - !expect status to_equal 200
      - !expect body to_be_array
```

## Variables in CI

When you run the CLI in a CI environment, all environment variables provided by that CI will be available in the `env` scope. For example, if you use GitHub Actions, [this is what you can do](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environment-variables).
