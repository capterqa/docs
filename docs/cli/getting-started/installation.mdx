## NPM

You can install the Capter CLI through NPM or Yarn:

```sh
# npm
npm i @capterqa/cli --save-dev

yarn add @capterqa/cli --dev
```

```

### With `npx`

Another way to use Capter without actually installing it is running it through [`npx`](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/162869356040/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner):

```sh
npx capter
```

## Cargo

```sh
cargo install capter --vers [VERSION]
```

Head over to [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/capter) and check for the latest version number.
