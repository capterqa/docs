After [installing the Capter CLI](/cli/getting-started/installation) it's time to create your first _workflow_. You write your workflows in **YAML**, which should be a familiar language if you have used something like GitHub Actions or Travis CI before.

You can create as many _worfklows_ as you'd like, and you put them in a `./capter` folder at the root of your project.

### 1. Create a workflow

A workflow in Capter consists of one or more of requests, and then assertions on the responses of those requests. Below is a mimimal workflow that checks if the `/health` endpoint of our API returns `200`:

```yml
# ./capter/health.yml

name: health check
steps:
  - name: check /health
    url: https://fake-api.capter.io/api/health
    assertions:
      - !expect status to_equal 200
```

### 2. Run the CLI

The next step is to run the CLI. Depending on how you installed Capter, the way to run it might differ – but for the most part you can just run the `capter test` command:

```sh
capter test
```

You should see something like this:

## Where to go from here?

Just checking the health endpoint is probably not why you're looking in to Capter – there are a lot of other tools that can do that! The next step is to learn how to [compose requests](/cli/getting-started/composing-requests).
