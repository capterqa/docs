Capter is a lightweight end-to-end testing tool for APIs. It's language agnostic and can test APIs written in any language (Node.js, Go etc).

- üßë‚Äçüíª Write tests in YAML
- üîé Run the same tests locally, in CI, or as a cron job to monitor your live APIs
- üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Takes less than a minute to get started

## How it works

### Workflows

Create your workflows in a folder called `.capter/`. These are YAML files containing instructions on how what the tests should test.

```yaml
# .capter/products.yml

name: products
steps:
  - name: fetch all products
    id: products
    url: ${{ env.URL }}/api/products
    assertions:
      - !assert status equal 200
      - !assert body isArray

  - name: fetch first product
    url: ${{ env.URL }}/api/posts/${{ products.response.body.0.id }}
    assertions:
      - !assert body.id equal ${{ products.response.body.0.id }}
```

As you can see in the example above, we're passing `${{ env.URL }}` and `${{ products.response.body.0.id }}`. The workflows are compiled run time and those will be replace with actual values.

`env.URL` will be replaced by the environment variable we pass when running the CLI, and `products.response.body.0.id` will be replaced by a value in the response from the first request.

### The Capter CLI

When you run the CLI, it will look for workflows in the `.capter/` folder and run them sequentially.

```sh
$ URL=http://localhost:3000 capter test
```
