Capter is a lightweight end-to-end testing tool for APIs. It's language agnostic and can test APIs written in any language (Node.js, Go etc).

- 🧑‍💻 Write tests in YAML
- 🔎 Run the same tests locally, in CI, or as a cron job to monitor your live APIs
- 🏃‍♂️ Takes less than a minute to get started

## How it works

### Workflows

Capter workflows are YAML files where you write your tests:

```yml
# ./capter/health.yml

name: health check
steps:
  - name: check /health
    url: https://fake-api.capter.io/api/health
    assertions:
      - !assert status equal 200
```

The example above is very small and doesn't do much. Have a look at the [get started guide](/cli/guide/getting-started) to learn how to add more steps, assertions and how to compose advanced requests.

### The Capter CLI

When you run the CLI, it will look for workflows in the `.capter/` folder and run them sequentially.

```sh
$ capter test
```
